# various_programming_projects
A compilation of all my personal coding projects

Here are various projects I have completed on my own.  Some were done in collaboration with other a couple other students in my Physics 410 class at UBC but the majority of the work in those was still done individually.  The projects range from physics simulations to predictive modeling with data science. I also built a functioning alarm clock with a msp430G2553 microcontroller.  All code is open to those who would like to use it.
